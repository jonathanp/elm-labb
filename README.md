# Elm-labb

This is the first project/demo I've made to learn the beautiful [Elm](http://elm-lang.org). The functionality is the same as in this [React demo](https://binarymuse.github.io/react-primer/build/index.html?6) since I figured it was a good fit for trying out the architecture.


## How to build

1. [Install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `elm-reactor` from the project directory
4. Open <http://localhost:8000/Main.elm> in your favorite browser
